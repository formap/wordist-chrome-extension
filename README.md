# wordist

A dictionary chrome extension that shows you definitions and relevant information about words without having to leave the page.

Install the Chrome Extension, and help us make it better! After installing the extension, you should be able to open *wordist* on any website using the context menu (right click) or the search command (Ctrl+Shift+Z by default).

*Content scripts can't modify some websites/paths, like the Chrome Web Store, any `chrome://...` window, your homepage, the new tab window, ... so you won't be able to open wordist there.*

## Features

- **Search** for definitions and relevant information about words.
- **Links** to Wikipedia.
- **Save** a **history** of all searched words.
- **View** and **search history** of words and definitions. 

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> - Default command to search for the highlighted word.
- <kbd>esc</kbd> - Close open pop-up.

You can change/set a custom command for toggling pop-ups in the Keyboard shortcuts configuration modal at the bottom of the Chrome Extensions page.
